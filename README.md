# where-is-the-ISS
repo for my api project, Where is the ISS? (International Space Station)

This app will utilize at least two apis and will allow users to do three things: 
1. find the current location of the ISS
2. find the time of the next pass of the ISS over a user-specified location
3. find the predicted location of the ISS at a user-specified future date and time
