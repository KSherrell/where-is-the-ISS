# Where Is the ISS API Capstone
repo for my api capstone project, Where is the ISS? (International Space Station)

## User Cases
This app is for three types of users.
1. As an amateur astronomer, I want to find the current location of the ISS in order to track the path of the ISS in real-time.
2. As a space enthusiast, I want to find the time of the next pass of the ISS over my location so that I may possibly view the ISS.
3. As an elementary school teacher, I want to find the predicted location of the ISS at a future date and time to plan for future viewings and share that with my students.
