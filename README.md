# "Where Is the ISS?" - Thinkful API Capstone Project
A responsive website that pulls data from two APIs, Open Notify (http://open-notify.org) and Google Maps (https://console.developers.google.com/) to enable users to track the location of the International Space Station (ISS) over the Earth.

## User Cases
This app is for three types of users.
1. As an amateur astronomer, I want to find the current location of the ISS in order to track the path of the ISS in real-time.
2. As a space travel enthusiast, I want to find the time of the next pass of the ISS over my location so that I may possibly view the ISS.
3. As an elementary school teacher, I want to find the predicted location of the ISS at a future date and time to plan for future viewings and share that with my students.
